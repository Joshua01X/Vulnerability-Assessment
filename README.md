# Vulnerability-Assessment

## Scenario
You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, as many employees work remotely from various locations worldwide. Employees regularly query or request data from the server to find potential customers. Since the company's launch three years ago, the database has been open to the public, presenting a serious vulnerability.

You are tasked with completing a vulnerability assessment of the situation to communicate potential risks to decision-makers at the company. You must create a written report explaining how the vulnerable server risks business operations and how it can be secured.

### System Description

- **Server Hardware:** Powerful CPU processor, 128GB of memory.
- **Operating System:** Latest version of Linux.
- **Database Management System:** MySQL.
- **Network Configuration:** Stable connection using IPv4 addresses, interacts with other servers on the network.
- **Security Measures:** SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

### Scope

The scope of this vulnerability assessment covers the current access controls of the system from June 2024 to August 2024, guided by NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 for risk analysis.

### Purpose

With a considerable number of remote employees globally, the company’s database server is crucial for consistent and efficient operations. Securing the database server is a priority to prevent disruptions in online business operations, critical transactions, or communications in the event of a security breach.

### Risk Assessment

| Threat Source   | Threat Event                                            | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------|----------|------|
| Hacker          | Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration          | 3          | 3        | 9    |
| Processing      | Overload of processing power from too many simultaneous operations | 2          | 2        | 4    |
| Power Outages   | Temporary blackout caused by extreme weather conditions | 1          | 2        | 2    |


### Approach

Keeping the database server open to the public poses a significant threat to the organization’s internal network. This vulnerability allows malicious actors to easily infiltrate and compromise the server. The threat of processing overload is relevant due to the lack of backup servers, as mentioned, which indicates a single point of failure. Given the company’s global network, the server could face performance issues or overload. Additionally, power outages from unpredictable weather, such as heavy thunderstorms, could affect the power grid and delay restoration.

### Remediation Strategy

To address these threats, the following remediation measures are recommended:

1. **Security Measures:** Implement a strict password management system, install firewalls, use proxy servers, and deploy IDS/IPS tools for continuous activity monitoring. Reinforce various access controls.
2. **Backup Servers:** Deploy additional database servers for backup to ensure quick recovery in case the main server is compromised. This will reduce the attack surface and enhance the organization's security posture.

These measures will help prevent potential security events and ensure a more robust security framework.
